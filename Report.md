5. Why can't we use the delay function with Blynk?

   Blynk is based on event so delay functions will not work.

6. What does it mean for a function to be "Blocking"?

    Nothing else can be happening while this function is running.

7. Why are interrupts useful for writing Non-Blocking code?

    Allows certain events to have priority without using blocking.

8. What is the difference between interface and implementation? Why is it important?

   Interfacing is how your functions are called, but implementation will describe what your function is doing.
